Infos for other modders:
This mod modifies the Container Items of the TFC Pot to itself in order to make a lot of recipes possible.
This mod modifies the configs of Pam's harvestcraft you can disable this in the configs.
If you want to make a mod compatible with PH you should add your food items to the OreDicts used by PH.
If your mod is in the compatible list you dont have to add your items to the oredict because my mod automaticly detects them and adds them to their oreDicts.
